Welcome to my Personal Assistant project!

The goal of this project is to hone my skills and gain more knowledge by
building tools. I will be building a RAG agent with an LLM to help me (and
possibly others) with revising their (probably chaotic) notes. 

The tech stack consists of purely Python. The following libraries 
will be used: 

- FastAPI
- LangChain
- Google Vertex AI
- Google Cloud AI Platform
- FAISS
- dotenv
- streamlit (Frontend)

I chose Google's API for convenience, since I have quite a few GCP credits
and would like to use them. Feel free to rework the code to fit your preferences, 
for example using OpenAI's API, and so on. 

I plan on extending the project by implementing an image pipeline too, and 
eventually creating a discord bot for my friends to use for servers which would 
make it much easier to find funny messages people have sent.
