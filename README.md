Welcome to my Personal Assistant project!

The goal of this project is to hone my skills and gain more knowledge by
building tools. I will be building a RAG agent with an LLM to help me (and
possibly others) with revising their (probably chaotic) notes. 

The tech stack will consist largely of Python. The following libraries 
will be used: 

- FastAPI
- LangChain
- Google Vertex AI
- FAISS
- dotenv

I chose Google's API for convenience, since I have quite a few GCP credits
and would like to use them. Feel free to rework the code to fit your preferences, 
for example using OpenAI's API, and so on.
